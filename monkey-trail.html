                    <h3>MONKEY-TRAIL</h3>
     <p>On July 10,the Monkey Trail got underway, and witin a few days hordes of spectators and reporters had descended on Dayton as preachers set up revival tents along the  city's main street to keep the faithful stirred up. Inside the Rhea County Courthouse, the defense suffered early setbacks when Judge John Raulston ruled against their attempt to prove the law unconstitutional and then refused to end his practice of opening each day proceeding with prayer.</p>
     <p>Outside, Dayton took on a carnival like atmosphere as an exhibit featuring two chimpanzees and a supposed missin link opened in town, and vendors sold Bibles, toy monkeys, hot dogs, and lemonade. The missing link was in fact JovViens of Burlington, Vermont, a 51 years old man who was of short stature and possessed a receding forehead and a protruding jaw. One of the chimpanzees named Joe Mendi wore a plaid suit, a brown fedora, and white spats, and entertained Dayton's citizens by monkeying around on the courthouse lawn.</p>
     <p>In front of several thousand spectators in the open air, Darrow changed his tactics and as his sole witness called Bryan in an attempt to discredit his literal interpretation of the Bible. In a searching examination, Bryan was sujected to severe ridicule and forced to make ignorant and contradictoru statements to the amusement of the crowd. On July 21, in his closing speech, Darrow asked the jury to return a verdict of guilty in order that the case might be appealed.</p>
